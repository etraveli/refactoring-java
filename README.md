#Refactored

1. Created skeleton for the application
2. Introduced MovieCode parameterized enum to be used as generic configuration for MovieRental amount and bonus 
3. Converting the logic of creation of information slip with the generic configuration.
4. In this case MovieCode is an enum class, but as well can be done as it own model, and there can be a flow of changing it on fly by the admin
