# Andr√©'s comments

- I took the simplest approach.
- Not being sure of exactly what you want/expect, I opted to keep to not transform the project into a maven one.
  - That makes it impossible (to my knowledge) to write tests using JUnit or TestNG.
- That said, I wrote some comments in the code and changed some existing ones + detailed the commit messages.
- Because I sticked with the existing example, I didn't cover input validation such as negative values or empty arrays.

# Refactoring Java

The code creates an information slip about movie rentals.
Rewrite and improve the code after your own liking.

Think: you are responsible for the solution, this is a solution you will have to put your name on.

## Handing in the assignment

Reason how you have been thinking and the decisions you took.
You can hand in the result any way you feel (git patch, pull-request or ZIP-file).
Note: the Git history must be included.

## To run the test:

```
javac src/*.java
java -cp src Main
```
