/**
 * Making a class immutable should be a priority, especially in environments where concurrency, security, and data consistency are paramount.
 * Since DTOs are immutable objects, the data remains consistent after the DTO object has been constructed.
 * The client canâ€™t directly alter the data once the DTO is received.
 * Use final keyword with classes when possible to ensure they cannot be subclassed, adding an extra layer of immutability.
 * Ensuring classes are immutable where possible to enhance thread safety and data integrity
 * Validation: Added validation to ensure that we have non-null, valid data to work with, making the system more robust.
 * Encapsulated movie data within the Movie class, making the code more object-oriented and easier to manage.
